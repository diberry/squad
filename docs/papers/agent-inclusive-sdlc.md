# Agent-Inclusive Software Development Lifecycle

**Author:** Flight (Lead, Mission Control)  
**Date:** March 16, 2026  
**Status:** High Priority (Brady Request)

## Executive Summary

This paper examines how AI agents participate as first-class contributors across every phase of the software development lifecycle. Using Squad—a programmable multi-agent runtime for GitHub Copilot—as the concrete implementation, we demonstrate specific patterns, protocols, and workflows that enable agent teams to operate with the same rigor as human teams.

This is not a theoretical framework. Every pattern described here has been tested through 3,931 automated tests and validated through Squad's own dogfooding: the Squad team builds Squad using Squad.

## Introduction: Beyond Chatbot-Driven Development

The emergence of AI coding assistants has created a false dichotomy: either you have a human developer working with an assistant, or you have a chatbot wearing different hats pretending to be a team. Squad rejects this binary.

**The Squad Model:**
- Each team member is a persistent agent with a dedicated charter stored in `.squad/agents/{name}/charter.md`
- Each agent has its own knowledge base in `.squad/agents/{name}/history.md` that accumulates learning across sessions
- The Coordinator routes work based on domain expertise defined in `.squad/routing.md`
- Agents work in parallel when tasks are independent, collaborating through defined handoff protocols
- All decisions are recorded in `.squad/decisions.md` using append-only semantics with merge-conflict-free Git attributes

This architectural foundation enables agent teams to participate meaningfully in each phase of the SDLC.

---

## Phase 1: Requirements and Planning

### How Agents Participate

#### PRD Mode: Ingesting Specifications

Squad supports a "PRD Mode" where the user provides a product requirements document. The Lead agent (Flight) parses this into work items, identifies dependencies, and proposes a team composition.

**Example workflow:**
```
User: "Here's our PRD for the authentication module..."
Flight: Reads PRD → Identifies 4 work streams:
  1. Core auth logic (EECOM - Core Dev)
  2. TypeScript types (CONTROL - TypeScript Engineer)
  3. Test suite (FIDO - Quality Owner)
  4. API documentation (PAO - DevRel)
```

The Lead doesn't just assign work—it performs dependency analysis. If the tester needs the API contracts before writing tests, the Lead sequences CONTROL before FIDO.

#### Ceremony-Based Coordination

Before multi-agent tasks involving shared systems, Squad triggers a **Design Review ceremony** (defined in `.squad/ceremonies.md`):

```markdown
## Design Review

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Trigger** | auto |
| **When** | before |
| **Condition** | multi-agent task involving 2+ agents modifying shared systems |
| **Facilitator** | lead |
| **Participants** | all-relevant |
```

**Real example from orchestration log 2026-03-10:**
```
Flight facilitates design review for PAO External Communications feature:
1. Reviews task: multi-phase rollout with SQLite-backed review state
2. EECOM proposes atomic INSERT...ON CONFLICT for concurrency
3. PAO identifies tone validation integration point
4. FIDO flags test coverage requirement for stale lock cleanup
5. Flight documents decision: SQLite-based locking pattern
```

The ceremony produces a shared context before code is written. This prevents the classic multi-agent failure mode: independent agents making incompatible assumptions.

#### Decision Capture at Planning Time

Architectural decisions made during planning are recorded in `.squad/decisions/inbox/{agent}-{slug}.md` and merged into `.squad/decisions.md` by Scribe (the session logger).

**Example decision from Flight's history:**
```markdown
### Proposal-First Workflow
**By:** Flight
**What:** Meaningful changes require a proposal in docs/proposals/ before execution.
**Why:** Proposals create alignment before code is written.
```

This isn't documentation debt—it's a requirement. The Coordinator enforces proposal-first workflow for substantial features. Agents cannot start implementation without an approved proposal on file.

---

## Phase 2: Design and Architecture

### Architecture Decision Records as Living Artifacts

Squad uses a lightweight ADR pattern embedded in `.squad/decisions.md`. Unlike traditional ADRs that become stale, Squad's decisions are enforced:

1. **Hook-Based Governance:** Security and PII rules are implemented as runtime hooks, not prompt instructions
2. **Type Safety as Contract:** `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json` is non-negotiable—CONTROL (TypeScript Engineer) blocks PRs that violate this
3. **Merge Driver for Team State:** `.gitattributes` uses `merge=union` for `.squad/decisions.md`, enabling conflict-free branch merges

**Real decision enforced by code:**
```markdown
### Hook-Based Governance Over Prompt Instructions
**By:** RETRO (Security)
**What:** Security, PII, and file-write guards are implemented via the hooks module, NOT prompt instructions.
**Why:** Prompts can be ignored. Hooks are code—they execute deterministically.
```

The `src/hooks/` module implements this. RETRO doesn't just advise on security—RETRO writes the guard code that executes before any file write.

### Design Meetings as Structured Ceremonies

Design meetings aren't ad hoc. They follow the ceremony protocol:

**Agenda (from `.squad/ceremonies.md`):**
1. Review the task and requirements
2. Agree on interfaces and contracts between components
3. Identify risks and edge cases
4. Assign action items

**Concrete example from 2026-03-15 orchestration log:**

```
Task: Fix Review Gate Concurrency Issue
Facilitator: Flight
Participants: EECOM, FIDO, PAO

1. EECOM presents the problem: file-based locks have race conditions
2. Team reviews alternatives: Git-based locking (rejected: too slow), 
   queue-based (rejected: complexity), advisory file locks (rejected: stale lock risk)
3. EECOM proposes SQLite atomic INSERT...ON CONFLICT
4. FIDO identifies test requirement: verify 1-hour expiration works
5. PAO identifies integration point: review state must be queryable
6. Flight documents decision in .squad/decisions/inbox/eecom-concurrency-fix.md

Outcome: Design approved. EECOM proceeds with implementation.
```

This is not a chat transcript—it's a structured output from a facilitated process. The design decision is traceable to specific agents and persists in the team's shared memory.

### Module Ownership Table

Squad maintains a module ownership matrix in `.squad/routing.md`:

```markdown
| Module | Primary | Secondary |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| src/adapter/ | EECOM 🔧 | CAPCOM 🕵️ |
| src/agents/ | Procedures 🧠 | EECOM 🔧 |
| src/hooks/ | RETRO 🔒 | EECOM 🔧 |
```

This enables the Coordinator to route issues precisely. When issue #287 involves `src/hooks/file-write-guard.ts`, RETRO is the primary assignee, EECOM is secondary. This replicates the CODEOWNERS pattern but is runtime-enforced by the Coordinator.

---

## Phase 3: Implementation

### Parallel Fan-Out: "Team, Build This"

Squad's killer feature is parallel agent execution. When the user says "Team, build the login page," the Coordinator spawns multiple agents in `mode: "background"`:

**Routing logic (from `.squad/routing.md`, principle 5):**
```
"Team, ..." → fan-out. Spawn all relevant agents in parallel as mode: "background".
```

**Real decomposition example:**
```
User: "Team, implement the authentication module."

Coordinator spawns in parallel:
1. EECOM (Core Dev) — src/auth/session.ts, src/auth/token.ts
2. CONTROL (TypeScript) — src/auth/types.ts, strict mode compliance
3. RETRO (Security) — src/hooks/auth-guard.ts, PII filtering
4. FIDO (Tester) — test/auth.test.ts, edge case coverage
5. PAO (DevRel) — docs/api/authentication.md

All run simultaneously. Each operates in its own context.
```

This isn't "multitasking" by a single LLM. Each agent is a separate spawned process managed by the runtime. From the orchestration log:

```
2026-03-15T16-44-42Z-eecom-bg.md — EECOM working on core implementation
2026-03-15T16-44-42Z-fido-bg.md — FIDO writing tests
2026-03-15T16-44-42Z-pao-bg.md — PAO drafting documentation
```

All three ran at the same time.

### Drop-Box Pattern for Conflict-Free Collaboration

How do four agents write code simultaneously without stepping on each other? The **drop-box pattern:**

1. Each agent works in its assigned module (defined by ownership table)
2. Shared interfaces are defined up front in the design ceremony
3. Agents do NOT edit each other's files during parallel work
4. Integration happens after all parallel work completes
5. If conflict arises, the Coordinator enforces strict handoff rules

**Example from Squadron (internal CLI tool):**
```
Task: Add real-time monitoring dashboard

Parallel work:
- Telemetry (Observability) → src/metrics/collector.ts
- DSKY (TUI) → src/cli/shell/components/metrics-display.tsx
- GNC (Runtime) → src/runtime/performance-hooks.ts

Shared contract (defined in ceremony):
interface MetricsEvent {
  timestamp: number;
  source: string;
  value: number;
}

Each agent implements its half. Integration test validates the contract.
```

If DSKY needs changes to `MetricsEvent`, it doesn't edit Telemetry's file—it proposes the change in the shared decisions file, and Telemetry implements it.

### Anticipatory Downstream Work

Squad's routing principle 6:
```
Feature being built? Spawn tester for test cases from requirements simultaneously.
```

This means FIDO (the tester) starts writing tests BEFORE implementation completes. How? FIDO reads the requirements and writes test cases based on the spec:

**Example from test suite:**
```javascript
// test/ralph-triage.test.ts
// Written by FIDO while EECOM implemented ralph-triage.js

describe('Ralph Triage', () => {
  it('should route core runtime issues to EECOM', () => {
    const issue = {
      title: 'CopilotClient session pool memory leak',
      body: 'src/client/session-pool.ts line 47'
    };
    const assignment = triage(issue);
    expect(assignment.agent).toBe('EECOM');
  });
});
```

FIDO doesn't need the implementation to write this test. The requirement is clear: issues mentioning `src/client/` should route to CAPCOM or EECOM. FIDO validates the contract, not the implementation details.

When EECOM finishes, the test already exists. If it fails, EECOM knows immediately.

---

## Phase 4: Code Review

### Reviewer Rejection Protocol and Lockout

Squad enforces a strict reviewer protocol (defined in `.squad/skills/reviewer-protocol/skill.md`):

**Rule:** When a reviewer rejects work, the original author is **locked out** from self-revision. A different agent must fix it.

**Why?** Self-revision after rejection creates defensive feedback loops. The rejected author becomes invested in defending their approach rather than accepting the feedback.

**Example workflow:**
```
1. EECOM writes authentication module
2. RETRO (Security) reviews → rejects: "No input sanitization on username field"
3. Coordinator: EECOM is now locked out
4. Coordinator spawns CONTROL (TypeScript Engineer) to add sanitization
5. CONTROL produces v2
6. RETRO reviews v2 → approves
7. Lockout clears for next artifact
```

**Deadlock handling:**
If all eligible agents are locked out, the Coordinator escalates to the user rather than re-admitting a locked-out author.

### Multi-Reviewer Gate with Different Perspectives

For critical features, Squad uses multiple reviewers in parallel:

**Example: 4-reviewer gate for external communications feature (from orchestration log 2026-03-10):**
```
Reviewers:
1. Flight (Lead) — Architecture and scope review
2. FIDO (Quality) — Test coverage and edge cases
3. EECOM (Core Dev) — Implementation quality and maintainability
4. PAO (DevRel) — Documentation and user-facing clarity

Each runs independently. PR merges only when all four approve.
```

This mirrors the real-world practice of getting "architecture review + security review + ops review" on sensitive changes. Squad makes it executable.

### CI Integration as First-Class Review

Squad doesn't separate "code review" from "CI validation." Both are review gates.

From `.github/workflows/squad-ci.yml`:
```yaml
name: Squad CI
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run lint
```

The Coordinator treats CI status as a reviewer verdict:
- Green CI = approval from "CI Reviewer"
- Failed CI = rejection from "CI Reviewer" with specific blocker (which test failed)

The `pr-merge-workflow` skill codifies this:

```markdown
### Required Gate Pattern

A PR is only ready to merge when all required gates are green:

Gate 1: Review completeness (human approvals)
Gate 2: CI health (all required checks passing)
Gate 3: Mergeability (no conflicts, not draft)
Gate 4: Freshness against base (branch is up-to-date)
```

Ralph (the work monitor) evaluates all four gates before merging.

---

## Phase 5: Testing

### Test Agents Writing Cases from Specs

FIDO (Quality Owner) writes tests in three modes:

1. **Anticipatory:** Tests written during implementation based on requirements
2. **Adversarial:** Tests written AFTER implementation to find edge cases the implementer missed
3. **Regression:** Tests added after bugs to ensure they don't return

**Example: Adversarial testing approach (from FIDO's charter):**
```
FIDO reviews EECOM's session pool implementation:
- Requirement: "Pool should handle 100 concurrent sessions"
- FIDO's adversarial test: "What happens at 101 sessions?"
- Bug found: Pool crashes instead of queuing
- FIDO writes test: test/session-pool-overflow.test.ts
- EECOM fixes implementation
- Regression test now guards against future breakage
```

### CI Integration and Automated Validation

Squad's testing workflow integrates with GitHub Actions:

**Ralph triage script (templates/ralph-triage.js) — zero-dependency CI integration:**
```javascript
// Parses .squad/routing.md to auto-assign issues
// Runs in GitHub Actions on issue open
// Zero npm dependencies for fast CI execution

const rules = parseRoutingRules(routingMd);
const assignment = matchIssue(issue, rules);
// Writes triage-results.json for GitHub Actions to consume
```

This enables:
1. Issue #287 opens mentioning "CopilotClient session leak"
2. GitHub Action runs `ralph-triage.js`
3. Script parses routing rules, matches "CopilotClient" → CAPCOM
4. Action auto-assigns issue to CAPCOM
5. CAPCOM gets notification, starts work

Testing is automated from issue filing to fix validation.

### Metrics Test Script Pattern

Squad uses a "metrics test" pattern for observable quality gates:

**Example: test/ralph-triage.test.ts validates routing coverage:**
```javascript
describe('Routing Coverage', () => {
  it('should have routes for all core modules', () => {
    const modules = listSourceModules('src/');
    const routes = parseRoutingRules('.squad/routing.md');
    
    for (const module of modules) {
      const route = findRoute(module, routes);
      expect(route).toBeDefined(`No route for ${module}`);
    }
  });
});
```

This test fails if a new module is added without updating the routing table. It's not testing code—it's testing team process compliance.

---

## Phase 6: Deployment and Release

### Ralph: The Work Monitor

Ralph is Squad's autonomous work monitor. Unlike other team members, Ralph doesn't write code—Ralph watches the work queue and drives PRs to merge.

**Ralph's workflow:**
1. Runs `squad triage` in watch mode (default: every 10 minutes)
2. Parses `.squad/routing.md` to understand work assignment rules
3. For each open issue/PR:
   - Evaluates merge readiness using `pr-merge-workflow` skill
   - Checks all four gates (reviews, CI, mergeability, freshness)
   - If all green: runs `gh pr merge`
   - If blocked: comments on PR with specific blockers

**Real example from Ralph's monitoring loop:**
```
PR #326 Adoption Tracking
- Gate 1 (Reviews): ✅ Approved by Flight, FIDO, EECOM
- Gate 2 (CI): ❌ squad-ci.yml failing (test/adoption-tracking.test.ts line 47)
- Gate 3 (Mergeability): ✅ No conflicts
- Gate 4 (Freshness): ✅ Up-to-date with dev

Blocker: CI failure
Action: Ralph comments on PR: "Test failing at line 47: expected 'aggregate-only' but got 'repo-listing'"
```

Ralph doesn't fix the issue—Ralph reports it. The assignee (determined by routing rules) gets notified and fixes it. Once CI goes green, Ralph merges automatically.

### GitHub Actions Integration for CI/CD

Squad's CI pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/`:

**squad-ci.yml — test and lint on every PR:**
```yaml
name: Squad CI
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    - run: npm test
  lint:
    - run: npm run lint
  type-check:
    - run: npm run type-check
```

**squad-publish.yml — publish to npm on release:**
```yaml
name: Publish to npm
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
jobs:
  publish:
    - run: npm publish --access public
```

**squad-triage.yml — Ralph auto-triage on issue open:**
```yaml
name: Auto-triage Issues
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]
jobs:
  triage:
    - run: node templates/ralph-triage.js
    - uses: actions/github-script@v7
      with:
        script: |
          const results = require('./triage-results.json');
          await github.rest.issues.addAssignees({
            owner: context.repo.owner,
            repo: context.repo.repo,
            issue_number: context.issue.number,
            assignees: [results.assignee]
          });
```

This is full CI/CD operated by the agent team. No human clicks "merge" or "deploy"—Ralph does it when gates pass.

### Watch Mode for Unattended Operation

Ralph runs in watch mode via `squad triage --interval 10`:
```bash
$ squad triage --interval 10
Ralph monitoring work queue...
Checking 8 open issues...
  #287: Assigned to CAPCOM (CopilotClient session leak)
  #293: Assigned to FIDO (Flaky test in ralph-monitor.test.ts)
  #301: Assigned to PAO (README missing quick-start)
Checking 3 open PRs...
  #326: Blocked by CI failure (commenting with details)
  #329: All gates green (merging now)
  #331: Waiting for Flight approval
Next check in 10 minutes...
```

This enables Squad to operate autonomously during off-hours. Brady (the project owner) wakes up to find PRs merged overnight if they passed all gates.

---

## Phase 7: Maintenance and Knowledge

### Knowledge Library for Persistent Team-Wide Storage

Squad stores team-wide knowledge in `.squad/knowledge/`:
- Not currently using hierarchical folders, but the structure is ready
- Scribe (session logger) extracts key decisions from orchestration logs
- All agents read shared knowledge before starting work

**Example pattern (from discussion, not yet implemented):**
```
.squad/knowledge/
  conventions/typescript-patterns.md
  architecture/event-streaming.md
  troubleshooting/ci-failures.md
```

The knowledge library solves the "second agent doesn't know what the first agent learned" problem.

### History Files for Individual Agent Learning

Each agent maintains a personal history file at `.squad/agents/{name}/history.md`:

**Example from Flight's history:**
```markdown
# Flight — Project History

## Core Context
Three-branch model (main/dev/insiders). Apollo 13 team, 3931 tests. 
Proposal-first: meaningful changes need docs/proposals/ before code.

## Learnings

### Adoption Tracking Architecture
Three-tier opt-in system: Tier 1 (aggregate-only, .github/adoption/) ships first; 
Tier 2 (opt-in registry) designed next; Tier 3 (public showcase) launches when ≥5 projects opt in.

### Remote Squad Access
Three-phase rollout: Phase 1 — GitHub Discussions bot with /squad command (1 day, zero hosting). 
Phase 2 — GitHub Copilot Extension via Contents API (1 week). 
Phase 3 — Slack/Teams bot (2 weeks).
```

Merge driver (`merge=union` in `.gitattributes`) ensures these files merge without conflicts across branches.

When Flight works on issue #350, Flight reads this history first. The lessons from #326 are immediately available.

### Skills System for Reusable Patterns

Squad skills are executable workflows stored in `.squad/skills/{skill-name}/skill.md`:

**Example: reviewer-protocol skill:**
```markdown
---
name: "reviewer-protocol"
description: "Reviewer rejection workflow and strict lockout semantics"
domain: "orchestration"
confidence: "high"
---

## Context
When a team member has a Reviewer role, they may approve or reject work. 
On rejection, the coordinator enforces strict lockout rules.

## Patterns
### Strict Lockout Semantics
1. The original author is locked out
2. A different agent MUST own the revision
3. The Coordinator enforces this mechanically
[... detailed rules continue ...]
```

Skills are invoked by the Coordinator when specific conditions are met (multi-agent task, reviewer gate, merge readiness check).

**Example skill invocations:**
- `agent-collaboration` — when 2+ agents work on shared systems
- `pr-merge-workflow` — when evaluating PR merge readiness
- `reviewer-protocol` — when a reviewer rejects work

This enables the team to codify "how we work" as executable procedures, not just documentation.

## Integration: The Full SDLC in Action

### Case Study: Building the External Communications Feature

Let's trace a complete feature through all SDLC phases using real Squad orchestration logs:

#### Requirements Phase (Day 1)
```
User: "PAO needs external communications capability - blog posts, release notes, tone validation."

Flight (Lead) spawns:
- PRD analysis: break down into 3 phases
- Team composition: PAO (owner), EECOM (infra), FIDO (testing), RETRO (hooks)
- Dependency map: Phase 1 foundation → Phase 2 review gate → Phase 3 automation
```

#### Design Phase (Day 1-2)
```
Flight facilitates design ceremony:
- PAO presents use cases: blog post generation, release note drafting
- EECOM proposes architecture: .squad/comms/ directory structure, SQLite review state
- RETRO identifies security concern: tone validation must happen pre-publish
- FIDO defines acceptance criteria: all tone violations must block publication
- Decision captured: .squad/decisions/inbox/pao-external-comms.md
```

#### Implementation Phase (Day 2-3)
```
Coordinator spawns in parallel:

EECOM (mode: background):
- Creates .squad/comms/README.md
- Implements SQLite schema for review state
- Writes templates/review-state-schema.sql

PAO (mode: background):
- Creates tone-validation.json rules
- Writes templates/audit-entry.md
- Drafts user documentation

FIDO (mode: background):
- Creates tests/ci-gate.md (integration spec)
- Creates tests/tone-validation-spec.md
- Prepares test fixtures

RETRO (mode: background):
- Plans hook integration for pre-publish validation
- Reviews SQLite security (no SQL injection via templates)
```

All four agents work simultaneously. Drop-box pattern prevents conflicts (each owns separate files).

#### Review Phase (Day 3-4)
```
Round 1: FIDO reviews EECOM's implementation
- Identifies blocker: Review state concurrency issue with file-based locks
- Rejects with feedback: "Use SQLite atomic INSERT...ON CONFLICT"
- EECOM locked out from revision
- Flight assigns revision to EECOM after design adjustment ceremony

Round 2: Flight + FIDO + PAO review together
- All critical blockers resolved
- Minor issue: inconsistent field naming in audit schema
- EECOM fixes (no lockout for minor issues with approval)
- All reviewers approve

CI validation:
- All tests pass
- Lint check passes
- Type check passes (TypeScript strict mode)
```

#### Testing Phase (Day 4)
```
FIDO's adversarial testing:
- Test: What happens if tone validation rules file is missing?
- Result: Script crashes instead of graceful fallback
- FIDO files issue #427: "Tone validation needs default rules"
- EECOM fixes with fallback behavior
- Regression test added: test/tone-validation-defaults.test.ts
```

#### Deployment Phase (Day 5)
```
Ralph monitoring:
- PR #426 (PAO External Comms) status check
- Gate 1: ✅ Reviews (Flight, FIDO, EECOM all approved)
- Gate 2: ✅ CI (squad-ci.yml passing)
- Gate 3: ✅ Mergeability (no conflicts)
- Gate 4: ✅ Freshness (up-to-date with dev)
- Action: Ralph runs `gh pr merge --squash`
- PR merged to dev branch
```

#### Maintenance Phase (Ongoing)
```
Scribe (session logger) processes orchestration logs:
- Extracts decision: "SQLite-based review state pattern"
- Merges .squad/decisions/inbox/eecom-concurrency-fix.md → .squad/decisions.md
- Updates PAO's history.md with external comms pattern
- Updates EECOM's history.md with atomic INSERT pattern

Knowledge compounds:
- Next feature needing review state? Pattern already documented.
- Next concurrency issue? SQLite solution already in team memory.
```

## Lessons Learned: What Makes Agent Teams Work

### 1. Explicit Contracts Over Implicit Coordination

The design ceremony isn't optional. When DSKY (TUI Engineer) and Telemetry (Observability) need to integrate, they don't "figure it out"—they agree on the `MetricsEvent` interface first.

**Why it works:** Parallel agents can't read each other's minds. Explicit contracts let them work independently with confidence.

### 2. Lockout-on-Rejection Prevents Defensive Loops

Self-revision after rejection creates a "defend my code" mentality. Forcing a different agent to revise brings fresh perspective.

**Why it works:** Rejected agents are emotionally (synthetically?) invested in their approach. A new agent reads the feedback without that baggage.

### 3. Persistent Memory Beats Context Window Tricks

Flight's `history.md` is 28 KB of accumulated project knowledge. That's not fitting in a prompt.

**Why it works:** Knowledge compounds across sessions. Flight today knows what Flight learned three months ago. The alternative (re-learning every session) is exhausting.

### 4. Ralph as Autonomous Merge Bot Requires Trust

Letting Ralph merge PRs overnight sounds risky. It works because of the four-gate system: reviews + CI + mergeability + freshness. If any gate is red, Ralph blocks.

**Why it works:** Ralph enforces process, not judgment. The judgment happened in the review gate. Ralph is the "did everyone sign off?" check.

### 5. Skills as Executable Procedures Scale Team Knowledge

When a new team member joins, they don't read a wiki—they invoke skills. The `reviewer-protocol` skill codifies 7 detailed lockout rules. New reviewers follow it automatically.

**Why it works:** Runbooks rot. Executable skills enforce themselves. If the procedure changes, the skill updates, and all agents use the new version immediately.

---

## Challenges and Open Questions

### Challenge 1: Merge Conflicts in Parallel Work

The drop-box pattern reduces conflicts but doesn't eliminate them. When EECOM and CAPCOM both need to edit `src/client/session.ts`, someone has to reconcile.

**Current approach:** Design ceremony defines clear boundaries. If conflict is likely, sequential execution instead of parallel.

**Open question:** Can we detect potential conflicts earlier (static analysis of import graphs) and proactively sequence work?

### Challenge 2: Reviewer Deadlock

If EECOM → rejected, CONTROL revises → rejected, RETRO revises → rejected, all eligible agents are locked out. The Coordinator escalates to the user.

**Current approach:** Escalation to human. The problem is too hard for the agent team.

**Open question:** Should we allow "appeal" where a locked-out agent can propose a fundamentally different approach? Or does that re-introduce defensive loops?

### Challenge 3: Knowledge Base Bloat

History files grow unbounded. Flight's history is 28 KB after 3 weeks. EECOM's will hit 100 KB eventually.

**Current approach:** No automatic compression. Agents read the full history.

**Open question:** Do we need a "nap" command that archives old learnings? Or hierarchical summaries ("2024 Q4 learnings: [summary]")?

### Challenge 4: Cross-Repository Agent Teams

Squad currently operates within a single repository. What about a microservices architecture where the frontend team and backend team need to coordinate?

**Current approach:** Not supported. Each repo has its own Squad team.

**Open question:** Should we build "distributed mesh" capabilities where teams can call each other? Or is repo-per-team the right boundary?

## Comparison to Traditional SDLC

| Phase | Traditional Human Team | Squad Agent Team |
|-------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Requirements** | PM writes PRD, eng team reads it | Lead agent parses PRD into work items with dependency graph |
| **Design** | Architecture meeting, whiteboard session | Design ceremony with structured agenda, decisions recorded in `.squad/decisions.md` |
| **Implementation** | Devs work in branches, coordinate via Slack | Agents spawn in parallel with drop-box pattern, no manual coordination needed |
| **Code Review** | PR review with GitHub comments | Multi-reviewer gate with lockout-on-rejection, CI as first-class reviewer |
| **Testing** | QA team writes tests after implementation | Test agent writes tests during implementation from requirements |
| **Deployment** | DevOps runs CI/CD pipeline | Ralph monitors work queue, auto-merges when gates pass |
| **Maintenance** | Tribal knowledge, Confluence docs | Persistent agent histories, executable skills, shared knowledge library |

**Key difference:** Traditional teams coordinate asynchronously through human communication. Agent teams coordinate synchronously through structured protocols enforced by the Coordinator.

## Future Directions

### 1. Multi-Repository Coordination

Allow agent teams to invoke each other across repositories:
```
Frontend Squad: "Need GraphQL schema changes from backend"
Backend Squad: Receives request, makes changes, notifies frontend
Frontend Squad: Receives updated schema, regenerates types
```

This requires distributed locking and cross-repo decision synchronization.

### 2. Adaptive Team Composition

Right now, team composition is manual (user picks agents). Could the Coordinator analyze the task and propose a team?

```
Coordinator analyzes issue #500:
- Keywords: "performance", "memory leak", "profiling"
- Proposes team: GNC (Runtime) + Flight (Lead) + FIDO (Testing)
- User approves or adjusts
```

### 3. Learning from Rejections

When FIDO rejects EECOM's work 3 times in a row for similar issues (missing error handling), can EECOM's history.md update with "FIDO always checks error handling—do this first"?

This is meta-learning: learning about the review process, not just the domain.

### 4. Agent Performance Metrics

Track per-agent metrics:
- Review approval rate (how often does this agent's work pass review on first try?)
- Test coverage contribution
- Decision authorship (who contributes most to `.squad/decisions.md`?)

Not for ranking, but for identifying when an agent needs charter refinement.

## Conclusion

Agent-inclusive SDLC isn't theoretical. Squad demonstrates that AI agents can participate as first-class contributors across requirements, design, implementation, review, testing, deployment, and maintenance—when the team uses structured protocols, persistent memory, and executable workflows.

The key insight: **Agents aren't augmented humans. They're a different kind of team member that requires different coordination patterns.**

Traditional SDLC assumes human communication (Slack messages, meetings, email). Agent-inclusive SDLC assumes structured protocols (ceremonies, skills, decision records, lockout rules).

The Squad model—persistent agents with charters, routing tables, reviewer gates, parallel execution, and Ralph monitoring the work queue—shows what's possible when we design the SDLC for both humans and agents from the ground up.

**The next step:** More teams adopting Squad, finding edge cases, and contributing patterns back to the skills library. The system learns not just from its own team, but from every team using it.
