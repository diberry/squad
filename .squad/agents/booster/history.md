## Learnings

### CI Pipeline Status
149 test files, 3,931 tests passing, ~89s runtime. Only failure: aspire-integration.test.ts (needs Docker daemon — pre-existing, expected). publish.yml triggers on `release: published` event with retry logic for npm registry propagation (5 attempts, 15s sleep).

### Known CI Patterns
SKIP_BUILD_BUMP=1 environment variable intended to prevent version mutation during CI builds. Currently unreliable — bump-build.mjs ignores it in some code paths. NPM_TOKEN must be Automation type (not user token with 2FA) to avoid EOTP errors in publish workflow.

### Workflow Inventory
9 load-bearing workflows (215 min/month) must stay as GitHub Actions. 5 migration candidates (12 min/month) could move to CLI: sync-labels, triage, assign, heartbeat, validate-labels.

### Container Smoke Test Patterns
`npm pack` generates tarballs installable in clean containers for pre-publish validation. GitHub Actions containers (node:20-slim, node:22) suitable for smoke tests. No devcontainer config exists yet. Current CI budget: ~227 min/month. Container smoke test adds ~2-5 min per run. Tier 1 smoke test commands: `--version`, `--help`, `doctor`, `status`, `export`. CLI has 31 commands; 15 are user-facing smoke test candidates. cli-command-wiring.test.ts catches unwired commands at build time (issues #224, #236, #237).

### Smoke Test Gating in Publish Pipeline
Smoke tests now run as a dedicated `smoke-test` job in publish.yml before any npm publish operations. Both publish-sdk and publish-cli jobs depend on smoke-test passing. Prevents publishing broken CLI packages to npm. Smoke test runs `npx vitest run test/cli-packaging-smoke.test.ts` after a full build. Test takes ~30-60s for pack+install validation.
