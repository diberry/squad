# Fork-First PR Pipeline

## Confidence
High

## Domain
PR workflow, cross-fork collaboration

## Problem Statement
PRs opened directly on the upstream repository get messy iteration in public. Code review feedback creates visible churn. Force-push history is exposed. This workflow keeps development clean by staging changes on the fork first, then opening a single clean upstream PR after review is complete.

## 8-Step Pipeline

\\\
BRANCH → FORK PR → REVIEW → FIX → BLEED CHECK → CLEAN → UPSTREAM → DONE
\\\

### Step 1: BRANCH
Create a feature branch locally:
\\\ash
git checkout -b squad/{issue-number}-{slug}
\\\

### Step 2: FORK PR
Push to fork and open PR **against your fork's dev branch**:
\\\ash
git push origin {branch-name}
gh pr create --base dev --draft  # Opens on fork/dev, not upstream
\\\

### Step 3: REVIEW
Iterate on the fork PR with teammates. Collect feedback via review comments. This happens in your fork, not upstream.

### Step 4: FIX
Address review comments. Commit changes directly to the feature branch (don't squash yet).

### Step 5: BLEED CHECK
Run a bleed audit to verify no stowaway files are committed. Check for:
- \.squad/\ files (should not be in app PRs)
- Navigation entries for wrong PR
- Test expectations for wrong PR
- Full-file rewrites
- Build artifacts
- Root-level strays

If bleed detected, fix on the feature branch.

### Step 5.5: REBASE
Before squashing for upstream, rebase the feature branch against `origin/dev` to avoid full-file rewrites:
\\\ash
git fetch origin dev
git rebase origin/dev
\\\

#### Shared File Strategy
For files shared across PRs (navigation.ts, test files, CI workflows):
- **Never** make full-file changes on feature branches
- **Always** reset to dev first, then make surgical additions:
  \\\ash
  git checkout origin/dev -- docs/src/navigation.ts
  # Then manually add ONLY the entries for this PR's content
  \\\
- This prevents diffs that rewrite the entire file, which cause merge conflicts with every other PR

#### Serial Branch Operations — Critical Rule

⚠️ **When multiple agents fix different PRs in parallel on the same physical repository (even if different branches), they all run `git checkout` in the same working tree.** This causes:
- Working tree conflicts (both agents try to update `.git/index` simultaneously)
- Commits landing on wrong branches (Agent A's commit lands on Agent B's branch)
- Race conditions (`.git/HEAD` and `.git/index` become inconsistent)

**RULE: Bleed fixes across multiple PRs must be done SERIALLY (one at a time) unless using git worktrees.** Never launch parallel agents that checkout different branches in the same repo without worktrees.

**Exception**: Use `git worktree add ../squad-195 -b squad/195-fix-issue origin/dev` to give each agent an isolated working directory.

#### When Rebase Fails
If rebase has conflicts on shared files:
1. `git rebase --abort`
2. Reset the shared files to dev: `git checkout origin/dev -- {file}`
3. Re-add only this PR's surgical changes
4. `git commit --amend --no-edit`
5. Continue with step 6 CLEAN

### Step 6: CLEAN
Prepare for upstream PR:
- Squash commits into logical units
- Clean up commit messages
- Remove any \.squad/\ files if present
- Check for stale TDD comments ("RED PHASE", "TODO: implement", "WIP") that no longer apply
- Verify no \/docs/\ prefix in titles
- Remove double blank lines from description

**Note on `.squad/skills/` files**: The `.squad/skills/` directory may be gitignored in some configurations. If you need to commit skill files to the fork, use `git add -f` to force them through, even if they match `.gitignore` patterns.

### Step 7: UPSTREAM
Open PR on upstream repository against \radygaster/squad:dev\:
\\\ash
gh pr create --repo bradygaster/squad --base dev --fill
\\\

### Step 8: DONE
Upstream PR is merged. Close or keep fork PR for reference.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Way |
|---|---|---|
| Open upstream PR before fork review complete | Public iteration, messy history | Complete review cycle on fork first |
| Force-push to upstream branch | Breaks links, confuses reviewers | Squash locally, push once |
| Skip bleed check | Stowaway files merge upstream | Always audit before upstream PR |
| Commit \.squad/\ files in app PRs | Repo pollution, merge conflicts | Exclude from staging, bleed check catches this |
| Open multiple PRs per feature | Fragmented review, merge chaos | One upstream PR per feature |
| Skip rebase before upstream | Diverged branch creates full-file diffs | Always rebase against origin/dev before step 6 |
| Parallel branch checkouts in same repo | Multiple agents switch branches simultaneously, causing working tree conflicts and commits landing on wrong branches | Use git worktrees or fix PRs serially |
| Forgetting to stash skill file updates | `.squad/skills/` files are gitignored, so they don't commit to the fork | Use `git add -f` when committing skill files |
| Leaving stale TDD comments in code | "RED PHASE", "TODO: implement" markers confuse reviewers after merge | Clean up all TDD markers before approval |

## Pre-Upstream Gate Checklist

Before opening the upstream PR, verify:

- [ ] **Flight approval**: Fork PR merged into fork/dev
- [ ] **FIDO approval**: Code quality, tests pass, no security issues
- [ ] **Bleed check pass**: Zero stowaway files, no \.squad/\ commits
- [ ] **Squash commits**: 1-3 logical commits, not N from iteration
- [ ] **Clean description**: No double blank lines, clear problem/solution
- [ ] **No \.squad/\ files**: Excluded from commit entirely
- [ ] **No \/docs/\ prefix**: If docs changes, they go elsewhere
- [ ] **No double blank lines**: Markdown/description formatting clean

## Team Review Protocol

The fork PR review phase enforces team-wide quality standards. These patterns are mandatory.

### Dual Reviewer Gate
Every fork PR must be reviewed by **BOTH Flight (architecture)** and **FIDO (quality)** before approval. The rule:
- **Both APPROVE**: Ready to proceed
- **One APPROVE + One REJECT**: Not ready — re-review cycle required
- **No single-reviewer approvals**: A partial approval does not unblock

Both reviewers must sign off in the same review round or in sequential re-review rounds (see Review→Fix→Re-review Loop below).

### Convention Issues Are Blockers
The following are **NOT nits** — they are blockers per team directive. Flight and FIDO must flag these as `NEEDS FIXES`, never as "non-blocking notes":

- **`/docs/` prefix in internal links**: Links like `/docs/features/memory` should be bare: `/features/memory`. The /docs/ prefix is stripped at build time; links must not include it.
- **Double blank lines**: Single blank line is house style. Two or more consecutive blank lines must be reduced to one.
- **Table ordering discontinuities**: If tables reference order (e.g., step 1, 2, 3), they must be sequential without gaps.
- **Whitespace violations**: Trailing spaces, tabs instead of spaces, or inconsistent indentation.

When a reviewer finds any of these, the review verdict is **NEEDS FIXES** with findings documented. The author must correct all flagged conventions.

### Review→Fix→Re-review Loop
After reviewers identify blockers:

1. **Fix**: Author addresses all blocker comments on the feature branch (use `git commit --amend --no-edit` for fast-forward fixes, or new commits if refactoring is complex).
2. **Re-run reviews**: **Both Flight AND FIDO must re-review**, even if only one reviewer found issues. This ensures convention fixes don't introduce new problems.
3. **Loop until both APPROVE**: Repeat until both reviewers vote APPROVE.
4. **Bleed check**: After both APPROVE, proceed to Step 5 (bleed check).

Do not skip to bleed check after a single reviewer fix.

### Reviewer Lockout
If Flight rejects a fork PR, the original author is locked out from self-revising. A **different agent** must make the fix and commit it. This is enforced mechanically:

- **Original author**: Locked from further commits on the feature branch after rejection.
- **Different agent** (e.g., Booster stepping in for PAO): Makes the fixes, commits, and force-pushes with `--force-with-lease`.
- **Re-review**: Both Flight and FIDO re-review the updated PR.

This rule prevents single-agent fixation loops and ensures peer review diversity.

### Known PAO Quirks (Watch for These)
If PAO is the author, Flight and FIDO should watch for:

- **`.squad/` file creep**: PAO often includes `.squad/agents/pao/history.md` or other `.squad/` files in commits. These must be explicitly excluded via bleed check or pre-commit rules.
- **`/docs/` prefix overuse**: PAO tends to add `/docs/` prefix to all internal links. Every reviewer must instruct "use bare paths — no /docs/ prefix."
- **Force-push caution**: Before PAO pushes, verify `git diff --cached --stat` matches intent and `git diff --cached --diff-filter=D` shows zero unintended deletions.

This is not a critique — it is a known pattern. Treat it as a checklist, not a personal issue.

### Review Comments Posted on PR
Formal reviews are posted to the fork PR as:
```
gh pr comment {pr-number} --body "REVIEW: {verdict}

## Findings
{findings}

## Summary
{summary}"
```

Verdict options: `APPROVE`, `NEEDS FIXES`, `REQUEST CHANGES`.

Findings should reference specific files, line numbers, and convention violations. Summary should restate the path forward (re-review required, bleed check next, etc.).

### Tamir Reviewer Rule
Only assign Tamir as a reviewer on **upstream PRs** where his original code PR is the source material for the content being documented. Do not add him to every upstream PR by default. On fork PRs, Flight and FIDO are the standard reviewers.

### Commit Hygiene
To ensure clean histories:

- **One commit per fork PR**: Squash all review iterations into a single logical commit before opening upstream PR.
- **Amend, don't create new commits**: Use `git commit --amend --no-edit` to fix blockers without adding commit count.
- **Force-push safely**: Use `--force-with-lease` to prevent accidental overwrites if teammates push simultaneously (rare in single-agent fork setup, but good practice).
- **Always verify before push**:
  ```
  git diff --cached --stat       # File count must match intent
  git diff --cached --diff-filter=D  # Should show zero unintended deletions
  ```

## Workflow Summary

This pipeline separates concerns:
- **Fork PR**: Messy iteration, team feedback, bleed capture
- **Upstream PR**: Clean, single-commit, ready-to-merge

Result: Upstream PRs are lean, reviewed, and production-ready.
